### Creating a New Setup

To start, turn on the plugin and click on the equipment panel icon on the sidebar.

![Panel Icon](readme_images_and_gifs/panel_icon.png)

To create a new setup, gear up for the activity you would like to save, and then click on the green plus button in the top right. It will prompt for a name, and then will take your current inventory and equipment and create a new setup.

![Green Plus Button](readme_images_and_gifs/create_new_setup.gif)

### Overview Panel

The overview panel contains all the setups and options to manipulate them.

#### Viewing a Setup

You can view the setup by clicking on the view setups button (the eye icon). You can see that your inventory, equipment, rune and bolt pouch (if present), spellbook, additional filtered items (explained later) and notes are saved in the setup. 

![View Setup](readme_images_and_gifs/view_setup_button.png)

![View Setup](readme_images_and_gifs/view_setup.gif)

It is also possible to view setups in game. You can do this by right clicking the "Show worn items" button in the top left of the bank, and clicking on one of your setups.

![View Setups in Game](readme_images_and_gifs/show_worn_items_view_setup.gif)

In the config there are options to change which setups show up on the "show worn items" menu.

You can go back to the overview panel by clicking on the back arrow in the top right.

![Return to Overview Panel](readme_images_and_gifs/return_to_setups_button.png)

You can also search for setups using the search bar. When typing in the search bar, setups will be filtered if they contain the search text.

![Search Bar](readme_images_and_gifs/search_bar.gif)

You can switch the overview panel to "compact" mode by clicking on the triple rectangular button at the top. Compact mode will only show the names of the setups on a shorter panel with no options so more can be seen without needing to scroll.

![Compact Mode](readme_images_and_gifs/compact_mode.gif)

#### Sorting Modes

Sorting modes allow for setups to be ordered in the overview panel in different ways.

Currently there is only one additional sorting mode, alphabetical. This will organize all setups alphabetically. You can return to the default sorting mode through the config or by clicking the alphabetical sort button.

![Alphabetical Mode](readme_images_and_gifs/alphabetical_sort.gif)

#### Moving a Setup

Is it possible to move a setup up and down the list by right clicking near the setup name and selecting one of the menu options.

![Move Setups](readme_images_and_gifs/move_setup_options.gif)

You cannot move setups if a sorting mode is enabled.

#### Favorites

You can favorite your setups so they always appear at the top of the list unless you are searching for a setup.

![Favorites](readme_images_and_gifs/favorites.gif)

### Editing a Setup

When viewing a setup, you can right click individual slots to update them, either from inventory/equipment, or from search. If you select from inventory/equipment, it will take the corresponding item from your inventory/equipment and update the slot.

![Update Slot from Inventory](readme_images_and_gifs/update_slot_from_inventory.gif)

If you select from search, it will open a search menu where you can search for the item, and then ask for a quantity if applicable.

![Update Slot from Search](readme_images_and_gifs/update_slot_from_search.gif)

The Rune and Bolt Pouch can also be updated with these options.

![Update Slot from Rune Pouch](readme_images_and_gifs/update_slot_from_rune_pouch.gif)

There is an option to remove items as well.

![Remove Slot](readme_images_and_gifs/remove_slot.gif)

These options are only available when logged in.

You can also refresh an entire setup by using the refresh icon when viewing a setup.

![Refresh Button](readme_images_and_gifs/refresh_button.png)

You can update the spellbook by right clicking the slot and choosing the desired spellbook. There is also an option for none if you do not care about the spellbook for a particular setup.

![Update Spellbook](readme_images_and_gifs/spellbook.png)

### Bank Filtering

One of the many buttons on each inventory setup panel is a bank filtering option. Enabling this will cause the bank to only show the items in your setup when being viewed. This is very similar to the bank tags plugin.

![Bank Filtering](readme_images_and_gifs/bank_filtering.gif)

You can also filter specific parts of the setup, like the inventory, equipment, and additional filtered items. You can use this to quickly gear up with equipment before filling up your inventory. To do this, right click on the "Show worn items" button when a setup is selected, and you'll see options to filter specific parts of the setup. There are additional hotkeys that can be configured for these options as well.

![Bank Filtering Equipment Inventory](readme_images_and_gifs/bank_filtering_equip_invent.gif)

When selecting a particular filtering mode, it will persist even when you leave the bank. In order to filter for all items again, you will need to select it from the "Show worn items" menu, or use the hotkey. Selecting a new setup will automatically be set to filter all items.

### Highlighting

You can enable highlighting to further assist in gearing up. Highlighting will cause slots to change color if an item in the player's inventory or equipment doesn't match the corresponding slot in the setup being viewed. To turn on highlighting, click on the button that looks like a highlighter. You can also change the highlight color with the next button over. There are also a few highlighting options for each setup.

![Normal Highlighting](readme_images_and_gifs/normal_highlighting.gif)

##### Stack Difference

Enabling this will cause a slot to become highlighted if the stack size of the item in the player's inventory or equipment does not match the corresponding slot in the setup being viewed. This might be useful if you are at the chaos altar training prayer, and you want to be sure you don't bring more gp than needed to unnote the bones.

![Stack Difference](readme_images_and_gifs/normal_stack_difference.gif)

Greater than or less than stack difference can also be selected. These highlight if the item stack in the inventory is greater than or less than the amount in the setup respectively. This can be useful if you want a reminder that a stack is too low or too high.

![Stack Difference Less Than](readme_images_and_gifs/less_than_stack_difference.gif)

Note that you must have base highlighting enabled in order to use this feature. There is a configuration option to set the default stack compare type for each slot when creating new setups.

##### Fuzzy Difference

Normally, Inventory Setups requires items to be **exactly** the same as those in the setup, else it will highlight the item, or not include it in the bank filter. This works for most items, but there are some cases where this is not desirable. Degradable items from Barrows are a great example. Ahrim's robetop 75 should be considered the same as Ahrim's robetop 100 for the purposes of highlighting and filtering.

It is possible to configure Inventory Setups to fix this issue using the "fuzzy" difference indicator. You can do this by right clicking any slot in the inventory or equipment panels, and selecting "Toggle Fuzzy". A "*" will appear in the top right corner of the slot if it is marked as fuzzy. The fuzzy indicator will make it so "similar" items are treated as equal for highlighting and filtering purposes.

![Fuzzy Difference Highlight](readme_images_and_gifs/fuzzy_difference_highlighting.gif)

As you can see, there are different types of items that the "fuzzy" indicator can be used on. Jewellery with different charges, degradable items like Barrows, and potions with different doses are a few examples.

The fuzzy indicator will also impact bank filtering.

![Fuzzy Difference Filtering](readme_images_and_gifs/fuzzy_filtering.gif)

There is a configuration option to set all slots to fuzzy when creating new setups.

##### Unordered Highlighting

Enabling this will cause highlighting to ignore order and only highlight items in the setup that are not present in the player's inventory. This is useful if you don't care about order and just want to make sure your inventory has all the items in the selected setup. It will not inform the player if they have extra items in their inventory that are not in the setup.

![Unordered Highlighting](readme_images_and_gifs/unordered_highlighting.gif)

### Additional Filtered Items

You can add additional filtered items to setups. These are items that will show up in the bank filter along with the rest of the setup. This is really useful for things such as pre-potting, where you need the item at the bank but not at the activity the filter is made for. Follow these steps to add an additional filtered item:

* Select a setup
* Break the bank filter and navigate to the item you want to add to the additional items filter
* Hold SHIFT and RIGHT CLICK on the item and select "Add to Additional Filtered Items"
* The item will now show in the bank filter and in the "Additional Filtered Items" section
* You can remove an item from this list by right clicking and selecting "Remove Item from Slot"

You can also add or update items by using the search option. The fuzzy indicator can also be added to additional filtered items.

![Additional Filtered Items](readme_images_and_gifs/additional_items_filter.gif)

### Exporting and Importing Setups

It is possible to import and export inventory setups. This is useful if you would like to share your setups with your friends. To export an inventory setup, click on the export button next to the view setup button. This will copy the setup to your clipboard. You can then send this to your friends.

![Export Setup](readme_images_and_gifs/export.png)

To import a setup, click on the green import button in the top right. It will prompt for a setup. Paste the setup and confirm. The new setup will be added to the bottom of the list of setups.

![Import Setup](readme_images_and_gifs/import.png)

You can also mass import or export by right clicking the import button and following the instructions.

![Mass Import Export](readme_images_and_gifs/mass_import_export.png)

### Configuration Settings

In the settings of Inventory Setups, you can change default setup options, key binds, and other miscellaneous settings.

![Configuration Settings](readme_images_and_gifs/config_settings.png)

* **Default Filter Bank** - Enabling this will make it so all newly created setups will have bank filtering enabled
* **Default Highlight Stack Difference** - The default stack difference option for all newly created setups

* **Default Highlight** - Enabling this will make it so all newly created setups will have highlighting enabled
* **Default Highlight Color** - The default highlighting color for newly created setups
* **Default Fuzzy** - Enabling this will make all slots fuzzy for newly created setups
* **Default Stack Compare** - The default stack comparison type for all slots in newly created setups

* **Return To Setups Hotkey** - Pressing this key will exit the current setup and return to the overview panel where all setups are shown
* **Filter Bank Hotkey** - Pressing this will cause the bank to filter if a setup is selected and filtering is enabled for that setup. This is useful if you canceled the filter while banking and want to quickly refilter
* **Filter Inventory Hotkey** - Pressing this will cause the bank to filter only the inventory of a setup if one is selected and filtering is enabled for that setup
* **Filter Equipment Hotkey** - Pressing this will cause the bank to filter only the equipment of a setup if one is selected and filtering is enabled for that setup
* **Filter Additional Items Hotkey** - Pressing this will cause the bank to filter only the additional filtered items of a setup if one is selected and filtering is enabled for that setup

* **Compact Mode** - Enabling this will change the setups to compact mode. It is equivalent to pressing the Compact Mode button on the overview panel
* **Sorting Mode** - The current sorting mode. It is equivalent to pressing the sorting mode button on the overview panel
* **Disable Bank Tab Separator** - Enabling this causes bank filtering to continue when the thin bank tab bar is clicked. This is useful if you are accidentally clicking the bar while retrieving items

![Disable Bank Tab Bar](readme_images_and_gifs/disable_tab_bar.png)

* **Remove Bank Tab Separator** - Enabling this causes the bank tab separators to be removed when the bank is filtered. This is just like the bank tags option.

![Disable Bank Tab Bar](readme_images_and_gifs/remote_tab_separator.png)

* **Require Active Panel for Filtering** - Enabling this will make it so filtering will only occur if the Inventory Setups Panel is selected. For example, if you have selected the hiscores panel and are viewing a setup with filtering enabled, the bank **will not** be filtered

* **Show Worn Item Filter** - Changes which setups show up on the "show worn items" button when right clicked.

* **Manual Bank Filter** - Enabling this causes the bank to not filter automatically when opened. You will need to manually trigger a bank filter by using a hot key or selecting a setup when the bank when it is already opened.

### Bank Tag Layouts Plugin 

The [Bank Tag Layouts Plugin](https://github.com/geheur/bank-tag-custom-layouts) is compatible with Inventory Setups and can be installed to create custom layouts for your bank filters.

![Bank Tag Layouts](readme_images_and_gifs/bank_tag_layouts.png)

### Compatibility with Bank Tags

Currently there is one known compatibility issue with Bank Tags. If Bank Tags and Inventory Setups are both enabled, switching the withdraw type from Items to Notes (or vice versa) will cause the filter to exit. This is unfortunately not something that can be fixed. The only solution is to turn off the Bank Tags plugin. More info can be found [Here](https://github.com/dillydill123/inventory-setups/issues/29).
